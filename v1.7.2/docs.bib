  abstract   = {We present a manifestly gauge-invariant description of Chern numbers associated with the Berry connection defined on a discretized Brillouin zone. It provides an efficient method of computing (spin) Hall conductances without specifying gauge-fixing conditions. We demonstrate that it correctly reproduces quantized Hall conductances even on a coarsely discretized Brillouin zone. A gauge-dependent integer-valued field, which plays a key role in the formulation, is evaluated in several gauges. An extension to the non-Abelian Berry connection is also given.}

   abstract  = {In topological semimetals such as Weyl, Dirac, and nodal-line semimetals, the band gap closes at points or along lines in k space which are not necessarily located at high-symmetry positions in the Brillouin zone. Therefore, it is not straightforward to find these topological semimetals by ab initio calculations because the band structure is usually calculated only along high-symmetry lines. In this paper, we review recent studies on topological semimetals by ab initio calculations. We explain theoretical frameworks which can be used for the search for topological semimetal materials, and some numerical methods used in the ab initio calculations.},

@article{Yang2011,
   abstract = {There have been lots of interest in pyrochlore Iridates A2Ir2O7 where both strong spin-orbital coupling and strong correlation are present. A recent LDA calculation suggests that the system is likely in a novel three dimensional topological semi-metallic phase: a Weyl semi-metal. Such a system has zero carrier density and arrives at the quantum limit even in a weak magnetic field. In this paper we discuss two novel quantum effects of this system in a magnetic field: a pressure-induced anomalous Hall effect and a magnetic field induced charge density wave at the pinned wavevector connecting Weyl nodes with opposite chiralities. A general formula of the anomalous hall coefficients in a Weyl semi-metal is also given. Both proposed effects can be probed by experiments in the near future, and can be used to detect the Weyl semi-metal phase.},

@article{Hirayama2015,
   abstract  = {We study Weyl nodes in materials with broken inversion symmetry. We find based on first-principles calculations that trigonal Te and Se have multiple Weyl nodes near the Fermi level. The conduction bands have a spin splitting similar to the Rashba splitting around the H points, but unlike the Rashba splitting the spin directions are radial, forming a hedgehog spin texture around the H points, with a nonzero Pontryagin index for each spin-split conduction band. The Weyl semimetal phase, which has never been observed in real materials without inversion symmetry, is realized under pressure. The evolution of the spin texture by varying the pressure can be explained by the evolution of the Weyl nodes in k space.},

@article{Du2017,
   abstract  = {Using first--principles density functional calculations, we systematically investigate electronic structures and topological properties of InNbX2 (X=S, Se). In the absence of spin--orbit coupling (SOC), both compounds show nodal lines protected by mirror symmetry. Including SOC, the Dirac rings in InNbS2 split into two Weyl rings. This unique property is distinguished from other dicovered nodal line materials which normally requires the absence of SOC. On the other hand, SOC breaks the nodal lines in InNbSe2 and the compound becomes a type II Weyl semimetal with 12 Weyl points in the Brillouin Zone. Using a supercell slab calculation we study the dispersion of Fermi arcs surface states in InNbSe2, we also utilize a coherent potential approximation to probe their tolernace to the surface disorder effects. The quasi two--dimensionality and the absence of toxic elements makes these two compounds an ideal experimental platform for investigating novel properties of topological semimetals.},
